/*
Implement a data structure called MinStack that works like a stack, but with an extra operation: return the smallest element in constant time.

The stack should support the following operations:

push(x): adds an element to the top.

pop(): removes the element from the top.

top(): returns the element at the top.

getMin(): returns the smallest element in the stack in O(1).

Usage example:

push(-2), push(0), push(-3)
getMin() -> -3
pop()
top() -> 0
getMin() -> -2
